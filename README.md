Fussball (Table Football) – FPGA Game Project
This project is a digital version of the classic table football (fussball) game, designed and built using an FPGA development board. The game is played between one human player and a robot (an automated paddle controlled by the FPGA logic). The project was developed using a top-down design approach, and it runs in real-time with display output on a VGA screen.

I was responsible for designing, coding (in Verilog), testing, and debugging all parts of the hardware. The game includes paddle movement, ball control, collision detection, a scoring system, and VGA graphics. The player controls their paddle using the board’s buttons or switches, while the robot paddle reacts automatically to the ball's position using a simple AI.

This project helped me gain practical experience with FPGA systems, modular design, and real-time hardware control. It was a great opportunity to bring together different parts of a digital system into a working game.
